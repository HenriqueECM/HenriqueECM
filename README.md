👋 Hi, I'm Henrique Menel (@HenriqueECM)

 👀 I'm interested in learning new technologies and building a solid career in IT as a software engineer.
 
 🌱 Currently studying **Software Development** at **CentroWeg**.

 💻 I'm learning both **back-end** and **front-end**, focusing on languages like **Java** and **JavaScript**.
 
 🛠️ I work with technologies such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Java**, and **MySQL**.
 
 🚀 I'm always looking to grow, improve my skills, and stay up to date with the latest in tech.
 
 🎯 Open to collaborating on projects that help me grow as a developer.
 
 🎮 In my free time, I enjoy playing *Formula 1* games and watching *One Piece.*
